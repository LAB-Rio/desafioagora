<p class="NumberedHeading2">1.2. You should print a copy of these Terms for future reference.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">1.3. These Terms are supplemented by the terms of website use&nbsp; and privacy policy of the website on which the Crowdicity Community you are accessing is based, our privacy policy&nbsp;and also the community rules of Crowdicity Limited which apply to all Crowdicity Communities.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>2. Information about Crowdicity Limited</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">2.1. Crowdicity, the Crowdicity Communities (other than any contributions made by any ideator and any material owned by the Community owner (where we are not the Community owner) and the Site are proprietary to Crowdicity Limited. Crowdicity Limited are registered in England and Wales under company number 7907506 and have its registered office and main trading address at 88-90 North Sherwood Street, Nottingham NG1 4EE. Crowdicity Limited&rsquo;s VAT number is 128527015.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>3. Accessing Crowdicity Community(s)</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.1. Each Crowdicity Community is operated by its Community owner (&ldquo;Community Owner&rdquo;). The Community Owner may be Crowdicity Limited or a customer of Crowdicity Limited. Where the Community Owner is a customer of Crowdicity Limited, the Crowdicity Community concerned will give certain information about the Community Owner, such as their full legal name, their county of registration (if they are a company), their company number (or any similar registration number), their registered office address (if they have one) and their main trading address. Their VAT registration number may also be given if they are a UK organisation and have registered for VAT. Where the Community Owner is Crowdicity Limited, this information is given in clause 2 above.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.2. Before participating in any Crowdicity Community(s) you must register with us by completing our registration form to create a new Crowdicity user account. If you prefer we can automatically complete our registration form using your information from your Facebook, Twitter, OpenID, LinkedIn, MSN Yahoo or Google accounts.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.3. After fully completing the registration form and submitting it to us, your account will be created and you will be given immediate access to all &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;public&rdquo; Crowdicity Communities. After submitting your registration form you will receive an e-mail from us asking you to verify your email address. If you verify your email address your access to all &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;public&rdquo; Crowdicity Communities will become unrestricted and you will be allowed to participate in all votes and receive updates from us. If you do not verify your email address your access to all &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;public&rdquo; Crowdicity Communities will remain restricted and you will be unable to participate in certain aspects of that community. You may, of course, verify your email address at a later date. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.4. Some of the Crowdicity Community(s) are &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Communities for access by those who are invited by the Community Owner to take part for the purpose for which that Community has been established. To access &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Communities you must click on the link in the invitation the Community Owner has sent to you. You will need to register an account to use the Crowdicity Communities if you do not already have one. You can, of course, request access to a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Crowdicity Community, but access will only be granted at the complete discretion of the Community Owner.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.5. Access to all Crowdicity Community(s) is permitted on a temporary basis, and the Community Owner reserves the right to withdraw or amend their Crowdicity Community without notice (see below) at any time. The Community Owner concerned will not be liable if for any reason their Crowdicity Community is unavailable at any time or for any period.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.6. If you choose, or you are provided with, a username, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms (or the documents referred to in them).</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">3.7. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Crowdicity Community(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>4. Use of Crowdicity Communities by children</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">4.1. If you are under the age of 18 years, you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian for your registration to use Crowdicity Communities. In such instances, you confirm, by submitting your completed registration form, that you have obtained such consent from your parent or guardian. We advise parents and guardians who permit their children to use Crowdicity Communities that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Children who are using Crowdicity Communities should be made aware of the potential risks to them and of their obligation to comply with these Terms (and the documents referred to in them) when using the Crowdicity Communities.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>5. Moderation</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">5.1. Whether a particular Crowdicity Community is moderated will depend on the nature of the Community concerned.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">5.2. Where a Crowdicity Community is not moderated, you understand that any contribution submitted to the Crowdicity Community is your sole responsibility. This means that you, and not the Community Owner, are entirely responsible for any contribution to the Crowdicity Community. Accordingly, where the Crowdicity Community is not moderated the Community Owner will not be responsible as author, editor or publisher of any contribution you make and the Community Owner expressly excludes its liability for any loss or damage arising from your use of the Crowdicity Community. Nevertheless, the Community Owner reserves the right to promptly remove, edit or to disable access to, any contribution which is deemed to be potentially unlawful, in breach of any third party rights or in breach of these Terms (or the documents referred to in them).</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">5.3. Where a Crowdicity Community is moderated, the mechanism for moderation shall be explained on the Crowdicity Community concerned. It may be that every contribution submitted to the Crowdicity Community will be checked by the Community Owner for compliance with the Community Rules before it is published or that every contribution is automatically published and checked for compliance with the Community Rules after being published. In either case, the Community Owner is not under any obligation to you or any other person to oversee, monitor or moderate the Crowdicity Community or any other service that the Community Owner provides and the Community Owner may stop moderating the Crowdicity Community at any time. Nevertheless, the Community Owner reserves the right to promptly remove, edit or to disable access to, any contribution which is deemed to be potentially unlawful, in breach of any third party rights or in breach of these Terms (or the documents referred to in them).</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>6. Submission of contributions</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">6.1. In each Crowdicity Community you can post a new idea (feedback, suggestion or the like) or a comment to an existing idea. You can also vote in polls that are held. Each Crowdicity Community will have a &lsquo;post&rsquo; button for ideas (the wording of this button could change from Community to Community). In some cases you can also add images and document files to support your contribution.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">6.2. There is no limit to the length of a contribution to a Crowdicity Community.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">6.3. Your username, photo (if you have uploaded one) and other personal information that you have provided for publication with your profile will appear as part of your contribution when published on a Crowdicity Community.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>7. Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">7.1. If you access a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Crowdicity Community you undertake to the relevant Community Owner that you will at all times during the period which your Crowdicity user account remains active, and for a period of 3 years after the termination of your Crowdicity user account, not disclose to any person any of the information and ideas (the &ldquo;Material&rdquo;) that you have seen or had access to when accessing such &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Crowdicity Communities, except that you may disclose the Material:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>7.1.1. to your employees, officers, representatives or advisers who need to know such Material for the purposes of participating in to the relevant &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Crowdicity Community, provided that you shall ensure that your employees, officers, representatives or advisers to whom you disclose the Material fully comply with this clause 7;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>7.1.2. as may be required by law, court order or any governmental or regulatory authority;<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>7.1.3. with the consent of the Community Owner; and<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>7.1.4. if the Material comes into the public domain through no fault of you or any person to whom you have disclosed the Material.</li>
</ul>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">7.2. You shall not use the Material for any purpose other than to participate in the relevant &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; Crowdicity Community or otherwise participate in such Crowdicity Community.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">7.3. Please be aware that you may also be bound by confidentiality obligations owed to the Community Owner based on contracts you have in place with the Community Owner such as, for example, under a contract of employment or contract for services. If this is the case, nothing in this clause 7 is intended to override those confidentiality obligations. Accordingly, in the event of conflict, those confidentiality obligations shall prevail.</p>
<p class="NumberedHeading1"><strong>8. Intellectual property rights</strong></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">8.1. By making a contribution to a Crowdicity Community:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

</ul>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">8.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or in any contract you have with the Community Owner (such as a contract of employment or contract for services), you will still own any intellectual property rights in your contribution (and may use it without restriction). However, the scope of the licence granted in clause 8.1.2 includes a right for the Community Owner (and in the case of &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;open&rdquo; Crowdicity Communities all other users of such Crowdicity Community) to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">freely use, edit, alter, reproduce, develop, publish, distribute, create derivative work from and/or otherwise commercially exploit your contribution and the intellectual property rights in it. This licence is free of charge, perpetual, irrevocable and capable of unlimited sub-licensing. </span></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">8.3. Please also note that, in accordance with the Community Rules, you must ensure that any contribution you make to a Crowdicity Community does not infringe any copyright, rights in design, patent, database right, trade mark, other intellectual property rights of any person or any obligation of confidence. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By making your contribution to a Crowdicity Community, you are warranting that you have the right to grant the non-exclusive licences described above.</span></p>
<p class="NumberedHeading2">8.4. If you are not in a position to grant the licences set out above, please do not make any contribution to any Crowdicity Community(s) or otherwise participate in them.</p>
